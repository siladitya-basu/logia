# LOGIA



Logia is my attempt to create an automated theorem prover by combining the widely separate (but not really that different :) fields of proof theory, evolutionary algorithms and computer programming. In its current form, it uses genetic programming to create mathematical proofs which are then verified by Coq, a proof assistant for a variant of higher order type theory that also avoids the halting problem. I plan to integrate a SAT solver, better genetic algoritms (with natural selection in mind) and machine learning.



## Getting Started

Get Python and the `numpy` library. I use [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) by Continuum Mechanics.

Next, download [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/download), a proof assistant for the Calculus of (Inductive) Constructions designed by Thiery Coquand.

Clone the repository and replace the ellipses with proper pathnames in `version_logia.py` accordingly, and you're all set!
